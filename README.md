Personal game engine development project. Plan is to build most things from scratch.

## Who is this for

ME :D

Upon studying a little bit of computer graphics, I got this dream of building my own engine to learn about cool things and build a cool project.

## Building

I will update this when there is something to build.

## Development

Some roadmapping was laid out... Short version is to get math and physics with some rendering on 2025. 
Then 2026 plan is to start working on a proof of concept game, and whatever I might want to work in parallel.
